# Split into teams
Split into two teams: 
**<span style="color:#bb0022">red</span>** vs **<span style="font-weight:bold; color:#0066bb">blue</span>**.
Each team will designate an adviser to give clues for the first round.

# Preparing advisers
Each adviser will need their own device (or the two can share one).
The advisers will click the "**show words**" link to reveal the colors of each word. 
The upper-right-hand corner will show which team's adviser will give the first clue.

> **NOTE:** It is important that no other players can see the adviser's device once the words have been shown.

# Giving clues
A clue consists of two parts: a number indicating how many words the adviser intends for their team to guess
and a **single** word. The goal is to get their team to guess only the words that match their team color and avoid the **black** word at all costs. 
The clue can only be one word and cannot be a word or a form of a word that is active on the board.

> **EXAMPLE:** Given a board with the words *apple*, *kiwi*, and *orange*, an adviser could give the clue "**3, fruit**"

# Guessing words

Once a clue has been given, the team can discuss which word(s) they are going to choose.
Once the team has reached a consensus, they can lock in a word by clicking it. If the word is not their team's color, their turn ends immediately.
If a team guesses the **black** word, they automatically lose.  Otherwise they can guess up to the number indicated in the adviser's clue.

> **NOTE:** After their first turn, a team may actually guess one more word in addition to the number indicated by a clue. 
> This is to allow guessing words that might have been missed in previous turns.

> **ALTERNATE LOCK-IN:** If the team does not readily have access to a device, they may verbally lock in their word by saying "Final Answer". 
> The adviser may then click the word to reveal its color to everyone.

# Winning

Teams will alternate turns giving clues and guessing. 
The team that guesses all their words first wins. 
After the first word is guessed, the upper-right-hand corner will indicate how many words are left for each team.

Once there is a winner, pick new advisers and hit "**new game**" to play again.
